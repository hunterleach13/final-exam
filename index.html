      	<center><h4>Steps on how to install PHP:</h4></center>
      	<p>
      		PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor and is used to website content that you can create Content Management Systems (CMS) such as WordPress and Joomla that we have used in class. PHP only needs to be installed on the web server that will host your application or browser.
		</p>
		<p>
			This type of text based coding can be used for a many different projects and takes time to complete based on the CMS you are using and how skilled you are at creating, designing and coding. PHPs general purpose is to script language that can be used to develop applications that run on a MySQL database. PHP runs off your web hosting server so an established connection must be made.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here I will be showing you the steps needed to take in order to get you PHP web server up and running using WordPress as an example while still keeping the overall PHP theme, so you understand the whole process.
		</p>
		<p>
			How does WordPress use a PHP? The code from the PHP is what makes your WordPress site run! It's all data stored in your MySQL and the PHP's job is to get that information and palce it into an HTML web page, which includes a file named .php extension. 
		</p>
		<p>
			First, you need to have a web hsoting system that supports PHP. There are many options that host this type of programming. These include WordPress, Joomla, Linux and more. If you got down the route of Wordpress or Joomla you must create an Amazon Web Services Account with Amazon and decide with CMS you would like to host your server. If you know which site you would like to use when you hit create instance you will be given options to choose where you would like you site to be hoted from.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, you need a Doman name for you browser, which will run automatically and install the CMS script. If it works you will need a username and password for your SQL to install your CMS script. you will be given a file called php.ini which is the default file where cahnges are found. You need to modify this file so you can add extensions and produce more content into your website. For Example: WordPress uses plugins and they need a mysqli and openssl extension to work.

			If you choose to work with WordPress you'll need to log in as an admin so you can take the IP address given to you and connect it to the bitnami page which will act as your PHP and MySQL link. Once you sign in with your username and password you will gain access to your WordPress server. Your server will send the code over the internet back to their browser. Which then the browser will take the HTML code and translate it into a web page. But when using WordPress your server needs to run PHP code in order to create that HTML page before you send into over to the browser. 
		</p>
		<p>
			And with that your website should fully function with PHP. Make sure to test to see if your PHP file works and if your site is up and running! You can customize the theme of your website if you so choose. WordPress and Joomla have free template themes that you can download but some do cost money so be careful, and to customize theme!
